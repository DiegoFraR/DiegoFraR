## Completed Projects

### Project 1: [Web-Based Calculator](https://github.com/DiegoFraR/Calculator)

This project was created for my Quality Assurance Course at KSU. This is a modified version that has cleaner code and a new UI. The premise is still the same as the one before. The general idea is to make a web-based calculator using Blazor Server. I also wrote various tests for the project using NUnit and Playwright. 

### Project 2: [Personal Website](https://studentweb.kennesaw.edu/~dfraust4/)
This project is a personal webpage designed to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript developed during my time in CS4720: Internet Programming at Kennesaw State University.
This project was created following this tutorial: [Cloud Champ Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU&t=4564s)
#### *ANY CODE FROM THE CS4720 SECTION IS FORBIDDEN TO BE COPIED.*

## Ongoing Projects

### Project 1: [BlogPost Website API](https://github.com/DiegoFraR/BlogPost.API) & BlogPost Website UI(Coming Soon)
This project was created in conjunction with the following [Udemy Course by Sameer Saini](https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-app-angular-aspnet-core-web-api-and-sql/?couponCode=THANKSLEARNER24).
The project uses a .NET Core (C#) API which an Angular UI calls to display, edit, and add blog posts. 

### Project 2: [Personal Website](https://diegofrar.github.io/)
This project was created with the following [YouTube Tutorial by Code Jungle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZj0j7rCcek&t=4235s).
The project uses HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap to create a personal webpage. 
This will replace the finished one from my KSU CS 4720 Course.
