## Completed Projects

### Project 1: [Web-Based Calculator](https://github.com/DiegoFraR/Calculator)

This project was created for my Quality Assurance Course at KSU. This is a modified version that has cleaner code and a new UI. The premise is still the same as the one before. The general idea is to make a web-based calculator using Blazor Server. I also wrote various tests for the project using NUnit and Playwright. 

### Project 2: [Personal Website](https://diegofrar.github.io/)
This project is a personal webpage I made for myself as another way to post my projects. It contains content about me, my studies, and projects I have made as I continue the path towards becoming a Software Engineer. 
It uses HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap.

### Project 3: [BlogPost Website API](https://github.com/DiegoFraR/BlogPost.API) & [BlogPost Website UI](https://github.com/DiegoFraR/BlogPost-UI)
This project was created in conjunction with the following [Udemy Course by Sameer Saini](https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-app-angular-aspnet-core-web-api-and-sql/?couponCode=THANKSLEARNER24).
The project uses a .NET Core (C#) API which an Angular UI calls to display, edit, and add blog posts.
